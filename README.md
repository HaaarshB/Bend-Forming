Bend-Forming is a computer numerical control (CNC) deformation process for fabricating 3D wireframe structures.
It combines CNC wire bending with mechanical joints to construct reticulated structures from a spool of wire feedstock.

This repository contains fabrication and accuracy algorithms for Bend-Forming, developed by Harsh G. Bhundiya at MIT AeroAstro. 
See the "Exemplary Structures" folder for examples of prototypes made with the process. For questions and comments, contact bhundiya@mit.edu.

Here is the Stanford bunny fabricated with Bend-Forming:
