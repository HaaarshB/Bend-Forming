Bend-Forming is a process for fabricating 3D trusses from a spool of wire feedstock.
It combines CNC wire bending with mechanical joints to additively construct reticulated structures from wire feedstock.

This repository contains fabrication and accuracy algorithms for the Bend-Forming process, developed by Harsh Bhundiya at MIT AeroAstro. 
See the "Exemplar Structures" folder for examples of prototypes made with the process.

Here is the Stanford bunny fabricated with Bend-Forming:
