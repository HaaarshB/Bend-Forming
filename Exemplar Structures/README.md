This folder contains images of exemplar structures fabricated with Bend-Forming:

- Antenna support structure
- Curved gridshell
- Isogrid column
- Stanford bunny
- Tetrahedral truss
- Truss hoop
- Utah teapot

Each subfolder contains 1) a script with the parametrized geometry; 2) a Matlab workspace with an example bend path; and 3) an image of a fabricated prototype. All the prototypes are made of 1-mm steel wire and bending is performed with a DI Wire Pro machine (a desktop CNC wire bender sold by Pensa Labs). The nodes contain either snap-fit joints, soldered joints, or zipties which hold the structure together.
